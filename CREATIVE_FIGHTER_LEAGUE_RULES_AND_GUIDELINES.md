## Introduction

Welcome to the **Creative Fighter League** - a competitive boxing league where fighters progress through tiers, compete in tournaments, and build their legacy through skill, dedication, and fair play.

### Core Principles
- **Fair Competition**: All matches are based on skill, tier, and rankings
- **Progressive Advancement**: Fighters start as Amateurs and work their way up to Elite
- **Respect and Sportsmanship**: Treat all fighters with respect, both in and out of the ring
- **Transparency**: All rankings, points, and match results are publicly visible

---

## Tier System

All fighters begin in the **Amateur** tier and progress through five tiers based on their performance and points.

### Tier Structure

| Tier | Points Range | Benefits |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Amateur** | 0-29 points | Basic training access, Local events |
| **Semi-Pro** | 30-69 points | Advanced training, Regional events, Basic analytics |
| **Pro** | 70-139 points | Professional training, National events, Full analytics, Sponsorship opportunities |
| **Contender** | 140-279 points | Elite training, Championship events, Advanced analytics, Media coverage, Title shots |
| **Elite** | 280+ points | World-class training, Global events, Premium analytics, Live streaming, Media interviews, Championship belts |

### Tier Advancement
- **Automatic Promotion**: When your points reach the minimum threshold for the next tier, you are automatically promoted
- **Tier Benefits**: Higher tiers unlock better training opportunities, tournaments, and exclusive events
- **Tier Lock**: You cannot be demoted below your current tier based solely on points loss (see Demotion System)

## Points System

Points are the foundation of your progression in the Creative Fighter League. Every fight affects your point total.

### Point Values

| Result | Points | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Win** | +5 points | Base points for victory |
| **Win by KO/TKO** | +8 points | +5 base + 3 KO bonus |
| **Loss** | -3 points | Points deducted for defeat |
| **Draw** | 0 points | No points gained or lost |

### Important Notes
- **Both fighters receive points**: Win or lose, both fighters' records are updated
- **KO/TKO Bonus**: Only applies to the winner (loser still gets -3 points)
- **Point Calculation**: Points are automatically calculated when you submit fight results
- **Point History**: All point changes are tracked in your fight record

---

## Rankings System

Rankings determine your position within your weight class and overall league standings.

### Ranking Factors

Rankings are calculated using the following criteria (in order of importance):

1. **Total Points** (Primary)
2. **Head-to-Head Record** (Tiebreaker #1)
3. **KO Percentage** (Tiebreaker #2)
4. **Strength of Opponent** - Average points of opponents faced (Tiebreaker #3)
5. **Recent Form** - Performance in last 5 fights (Tiebreaker #4)
6. **Win Percentage** (Tiebreaker #5)

### Ranking Types

- **Weight Class Rankings**: Your position within your specific weight class
- **Overall Rankings**: Your position across all weight classes
- **Tier Rankings**: Your position within your current tier

### Ranking Updates
- Rankings update automatically after each fight result is submitted
- Rankings are recalculated daily to ensure accuracy
- Your ranking affects matchmaking and tournament seeding

## Matchmaking Rules

The Smart Matchmaking system ensures fair and competitive fights by matching fighters based on multiple criteria.

### Mandatory Fights (Auto-Matched)

**Automatic Matching Criteria:**
- ✅ **Same Weight Class** (REQUIRED)
- ✅ **Same Tier** (REQUIRED)
- ✅ **Rankings within 3 positions** (REQUIRED)
- ✅ **Points within 30 points** (REQUIRED)
- ✅ **Compatible Timezones** (REQUIRED - within 4 hours)
- ✅ **No Recent Opponents** (Avoids matching with last 5 opponents)

**How It Works:**
1. The system automatically finds suitable opponents based on the above criteria
2. Mandatory fights are scheduled for 1 week from the match date
3. Both fighters receive notifications
4. Fights must be completed within 7 days of scheduling

### Manual Matchmaking (Weekly Mandatory Opponent Selection)

**Rules:**
- You can manually select a weekly mandatory opponent from suggested fighters
- Suggested fighters meet the same criteria as auto-matching
- **Opponent must accept** before the fight is scheduled
- You cannot accept your own mandatory fight request
- Once accepted by both parties, the fight is scheduled

**Acceptance Process:**
1. Fighter A sends a mandatory fight request to Fighter B
2. Fighter B receives a notification and can Accept or Deny
3. **Fighter A must wait** for Fighter B's response before the fight is scheduled
4. Only after both parties accept is the fight officially scheduled

### Fair Match Guarantees

- **Points Gap Protection**: If fighters have a >50 point difference, explicit consent is required
- **Tier Protection**: Fighters can only be matched within their tier
- **Rank Protection**: Rankings must be within 3 positions for fair competition
- **Timezone Compatibility**: Fighters must have compatible timezones for scheduling

### Demotion Protection
