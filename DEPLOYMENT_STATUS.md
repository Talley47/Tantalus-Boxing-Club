## Deployment Steps

I'm deploying your app to Vercel now. Follow along:

1. **Login to Vercel** (if not already logged in)
2. **Deploy to production**
3. **Set environment variables** (you'll need to do this)
4. **Redeploy** with environment variables

## What Happens Next

After deployment:
- You'll get a Vercel URL (e.g., `your-project.vercel.app`)
- You'll need to set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- Then redeploy

## Environment Variables Needed

After deployment, add these in Vercel Dashboard:

```
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

**Location:** Vercel Dashboard → Project → Settings → Environment Variables
